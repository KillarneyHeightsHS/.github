At Killarney Heights High School, we cater to the whole childâ€”the academic, the physical and mental wellbeing. In addition to this, we help develop skills that will enable your child to make the most of the future, with critical thinking skills which will carry forward into life beyond the classroom. We are a school that is underpinned by the principles of positive psychology, that is, we build on students' strengths and reinforce these at every opportunity.

This github space is another way we are preparing our students for the future. Students in year 9 and 10 studying Computing Technologies and those doing Software Engineering or Enterprise Computing in years 11 and 12 will be introduced to modern software engineering practices to prepare them for a career in software and hardware and to development an appreciation and understanding of how software and hardware play an important role in every facet of today's society.
